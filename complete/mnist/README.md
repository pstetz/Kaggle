# High Score: 99.142% accuracy on Kaggle's test data

The "Hello World" of Neural Networks.  The MNIST dataset are tens of thousands of handwritten integers in the range [0, 9].

Included is an analysis notebook to get to know the data and a submission notebook that provides predictions.

### Submission

A 10 layer Keras model is constructed with adam optimizer.  Below is my code for the Neural Network.  Initially there was inspiration from Kaggler Yassine Ghouzam's [work](https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/introduction-to-cnn-keras-0-997-top-6) however I believe I was able to evolve from it.  I added a couple more Convolution layers and increased the Dropout rate and I've found more success.

Excess data is generated by rotating, shifting, and zooming original data.  See the image below for the actual code.

### Analysis

Supplementary analysis is provided that contains primary feature analysi and PCA of the data.

### Logs

If for some reason you are so inclined, my iterations of success (or failure) are included in the logs
