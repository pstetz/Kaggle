# High Score: 99.142% accuracy on Kaggle's test data

The "Hello World" of Neural Networks.  The MNIST dataset are tens of thousands of handwritten integers in the range [0, 9].

Included is an analysis notebook to get to know the data and a submission notebook that provides predictions.

### Submission

A ~10 layer Keras model is constructed with adam optimizer.

Excess data is generated by rotating, shifting, and zooming original data.

### Analysis

Supplementary analysis is provided that contains primary feature analysi and PCA of the data.
