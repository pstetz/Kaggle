I apologize for this root folder seems bare.  All my work is in the logs folder here.  The files in the main directory are cleaned approaches so others can read more easily

That said, cleaning code can take awhile, giving some sort of explanation why this folder might be bare, yet in "complete"

### Logs

If for some reason you are so inclined, my iterations of success (or failure) are included in the logs
