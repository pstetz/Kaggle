Trying to use basic NN to identify flowers.  I abandoned this because there is no leader board to give me an indication of how well I'm doing.  Once I'm accustomed to what I'm doing, I'll pick this back up.

I apologize for this root folder seems bare.  All my work is in the logs folder here.  The files in the main directory are cleaned approaches so others can read more easily

That said, cleaning code can take awhile, giving some sort of explanation why this folder might be bare, yet in "complete"
