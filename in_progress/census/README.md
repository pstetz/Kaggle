# US Census Data ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data))

This is a Dataset of the 2015 US Census data estimate.  Since there is no competition, this folder is just an exploration of the data.

### Analysis

The analysis is contained in different folders to try and stay organized

- state_focus:  Focuses mostly on how relationships between States.  What state is the most populated?  Which state has the lowest unemployment?

### Logs

If for some reason you are so inclined, my iterations of success (or failure) are included in the logs
