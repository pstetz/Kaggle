# Kaggle Tutorials

## Dan B's [Machine Learning course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning)

Teaches the basics of sklearn like Random Forests and pipeline along with other topics like data cleaning, one hot encoding, and dummy variables.

## Dan B's [Neural Network course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning)

Currently only level 1 is here because that is the only level availible

Teaches the basics of Tensorflow and Keras.  Includes topics like transfer learning 

## Aleksey Bilogur's [Pandas course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

All the solutions are available however the data is not stored locally.  This folder is more of a reference to me on how to do certain pandas methods

## UC Berkeley's DS100 [SQL course](https://github.com/DS-100/sp18/blob/master/hw/hw4/hw4.ipynb)

I like this tutorial better than Kaggle's tutorial.  I think it's mostly because I want to run everything locally and Kaggle's SQL course requires ginormous data
