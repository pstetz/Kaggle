Code for Kaggle competitions

## (Project) [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

This is a problem in logistic regression.  There isn't too much information given however it's surprising how accurate the models can get.

## (Project) [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

This is a problem in large numbers of variables and outliers.  The secret for a good score is to remove some outliers and to remove columns that may be duplicates of each other

## (Project) [TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection)

There is so much data for this project, I'll save this project for a computer that can handle it.

## (Project) [Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo)

Fun machine learning project for 3 year olds and me

## (Dataset) [Flowers Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) by Alexander Mamaev

Trying to use basic NN to identify flowers.  I abandoned this because there is no leader board to give me an indication of how well I'm doing.  Once I'm accustomed to what I'm doing, I'll pick this back up.

## (Dataset) [The Interview Attendance Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/vishnusraghavan/the-interview-attendance-problem) by VishnuRaghavan

Predict which candidates will attend the intervew

^ Why would someone not show up to an interview!

# Tutorials (Found under Kaggle Learn)

## Dan B's [Machine Learning course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning)

Teaches the basics of sklearn like Random Forests and pipeline along with other topics like data cleaning, one hot encoding, and dummy variables.

## Dan B's [Neural Network course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning)

Currently only level 1 is here because that is the only level availible

Teaches the basics of Tensorflow and Keras.  Includes topics like transfer learning 

## Aleksey Bilogur's [Pandas course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

All the solutions are available however the data is not stored locally.  This folder is more of a reference to me on how to do certain pandas methods

## UC Berkeley's DS100 [SQL course](https://github.com/DS-100/sp18/blob/master/hw/hw4/hw4.ipynb)

I like this tutorial better than Kaggle's tutorial.  I think it's mostly because I want to run everything locally and Kaggle's SQL course requires ginormous data
