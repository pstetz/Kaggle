## Project 0 - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

 - New to Kaggle and seems like a good project to start off

## Project 1 - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

 - This project accompanies the Machine Learning tutorial by Dan B

## Project 2 - Neural Network tutorial

 - Stanford's CS 231 was a lot of theory, want to check out Kaggle's approach
