 - This project accompanies the Machine Learning tutorial by Dan B

## Project 2 - Neural Network tutorial

 - Stanford's CS 231 was a lot of theory, want to check out Kaggle's approach

 - Found under Kaggle Learn: Dan B's level 1 Neural Network course

## Project 3 - Flower identification

 - Trying to use basic NN to identify flowers

 - Kaggle dataset name: Flowers Recognition by Alexander Mamaev

## Project 4 - Bone Age
