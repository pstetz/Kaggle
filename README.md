## [(Project) Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

This is a problem in logistic regression.  There isn't too much information given however it's surprising how accurate the models can get.

## [(Project) House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

This is a problem in large numbers of variables and outliers.  The secret for a good score is to remove some outliers and to remove columns that may be duplicates of each other

## [(Project) TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection)

There is so much data for this project, I'll save this project for a computer that can handle it.

## [(Project) Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo)

Fun machine learning project for 3 year olds and me

## (Dataset) Flowers Recognition by Alexander Mamaev

Trying to use basic NN to identify flowers.  I abandoned this because there is no leader board to give me an indication of how well I'm doing.  Once I'm accustomed to what I'm doing, I'll pick this back up.

## [(Dataset) The Interview Attendance Problem by VishnuRaghavan](https://www.kaggle.com/vishnusraghavan/the-interview-attendance-problem)

Predict which candidates will attend the intervew

^ Why would someone not show up to an interview!

# Tutorials (Found under Kaggle Learn)

## Dan B's Machine Learning course

Teaches the basics of sklearn like Random Forests and pipeline along with other topics like data cleaning, one hot encoding, and dummy variables.

## Dan B's Neural Network course

Currently only level 1 is here because that is the only level availible

Teaches the basics of Tensorflow and Keras.  Includes topics like transfer learning 

## Aleksey Bilogur's Pandas course

All the solutions are available however the data is not stored locally.  This folder is more of a reference to me on how to do certain pandas methods

## Rachael Tatman's SQL course

I've actually decided against putting these solutions to my github.  I've done the tutorial, but I can't keep the data here to run everything locally.

In it's place I'm putting a SQL assignment that my friend gave from his UC Berkeley DS100 class.  This course seems to not need the data locally, it can fetch it from a server.  I should figure out how to do that.
